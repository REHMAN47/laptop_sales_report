# Background
In today‚Äôs data-driven world, businesses rely heavily on data analytics to make informed decisions. The consumer electronics market, particularly the üíª laptop segment, is highly competitive and fast-evolving. Companies need to track and understand their sales performance, customer preferences, and product trends to stay ahead.

Using advanced SQL techniques such as:

- CASE for conditional logic,

- WITH (CTEs) for modular query building,

- RANK() for identifying top performers, and

- TO_CHAR() / EXTRACT() for date manipulation,

### Questions I Wanted to answer through my SQL queries were :
1. What is the sales distribution between Windows 10 and Windows 11 laptops in the past month?
2. Which laptop model achieved the highest sales volume last month (*Top 10*)?
3. Which CPU brands or models led in laptop sales?
4. What is the distribution of laptop sales across different dates?
5. What is the distribution of laptop sales across different day of the week?

# The Analysis
Each query of this project aimed to derive valuable business insights, detect sales trends, and uncover patterns across time, brands, screen sizes, operating systems, and days of the week.

### 1. Sales distribution between Windows 10 and Windows 11
I selected the os column to group the data based on each unique operating system (like Windows 10 or 11).
Then I used COUNT(*) to count how many laptops fall under each OS. This gives us the total units sold per operating system.
I added GROUP BY os to ensure the counting is done per OS category, not across the whole table.
Finally, ORDER BY total_laptops DESC sorts the results so the most popular OS appears at the top.

```sql
SELECT 
    os,COUNT(*) AS total_laptops
FROM 
    laptop_sales
GROUP BY os;
```

#### Here is the Breakdown of laptop sales distribution between Windows 10 and Windows 11 :

The data shows a clear preference for Windows 11 OS, which accounts for the majority of laptop sales with 45 units sold, compared to just 4 units for Windows 10 OS. This suggests that most customers are opting for newer systems, possibly due to better performance, features, or future support. The shift highlights a strong market trend toward adopting the latest Windows version in newly sold laptops.

### 2. Laptop model achieved the highest sales volume last month
This query is designed to analyze sales performance of laptops by model and screen size. By grouping the records by product_name and screen_size, we can isolate each unique variant.
The SUM(price) gives us the total revenue generated by each variant, labeled here as best_seller, while COUNT(product_name) gives us the total units sold.

Ordering by total_units_sold in descending order ensures that the highest-selling models appear first, and LIMIT 10 restricts the output to the top 10 entries. The result highlights the most popular and profitable laptop variants in the dataset.

```sql
SELECT 
       product_name,
       screen_size,
       SUM(price) AS best_seller,
       COUNT(product_name) AS total_units_sold
FROM 
       laptop_sales
GROUP BY 
       product_name,
       screen_size
ORDER BY 
       total_units_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
#### Here is the Breakdown of Laptop model achieved the highest sales volume last month :

The graph highlights the top 10 laptop models by units sold, revealing that most high-end laptops were sold in very low quantities, typically one or two units. The Dell XPS 9720 leads both in units sold and revenue, suggesting strong demand for premium large-screen models. A majority of the best-sellers fall in the 15‚Äì17 inch range, indicating a consumer preference for larger displays. Despite their high price points, several gaming and performance laptops like the Asus ROG and MSI Stealth made the list, showing niche but valuable sales activity.

### 3. CPU brands or models led in laptop sales
This SQL query categorizes laptops by processor type using a CASE statement, labeling them as Intel, Ryzen, or Other based on whether the processor column contains those keywords. It then uses COUNT(*) to calculate the total number of laptops in each category. The GROUP BY groups the data by processor type, and ORDER BY total_laptops DESC sorts the results to show the most sold processor types at the top. This helps simplify varied processor names and gives a clear picture of processor-wise sales distribution.

```sql
SELECT CASE 
       		WHEN processor LIKE '%Intel%' THEN 'Intel'
    		WHEN processor LIKE '%Ryzen%' THEN 'Ryzen'
    		ELSE 'Other'
 	   END AS processor_type,
       COUNT(*) AS total_laptops 
FROM 
    laptop_sales
GROUP BY 
    processor_type
ORDER BY total_laptops DESC;
```
#### Here is the Breakdown of laptop sales based on CPU barnds or models :

This graph summarizes laptop sales by processor type, showing a clear dominance of Intel-based laptops, which account for over 65% of total units sold. Ryzen processors follow with 16 units, reflecting a growing but smaller share of the market. The 'Other' category, with just 1 unit, indicates minimal sales for less common or unspecified processors. This distribution highlights Intel‚Äôs continued market leadership in the consumer laptop segment.

### 4. Distribution of laptop sales across different dates.
This SQL query retrieves the number of laptops sold on each sale date. It uses COUNT(*) to tally the total laptops sold per day, GROUP BY sale_date to group the data by each unique date, and ORDER BY sale_date ASC to arrange the results in chronological order. The output gives a clear view of daily sales trends, helping identify patterns or peak sales days across the timeline.

```sql
SELECT sale_date, COUNT(*) AS total_laptops_sold
FROM laptop_sales
GROUP BY sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date ASC;
```

#### Here is the Breakdown of laptop sales across different dates :

This graph shows daily laptop sales across various dates in May 2025, highlighting fluctuations in purchasing activity. The number of laptops sold per day generally ranges from 1 to 6 units, with the highest sales recorded on May 18 (6 units) and May 13 (5 units). Other dates like May 8, 17, 21, and 24 also saw relatively higher sales, while most days saw 1‚Äì2 units sold, indicating a low but steady sales pattern with a few noticeable peaks in mid to late May.

### 5. Distribution of laptop sales across different day of the week.

This query calculates the total number of laptops sold on each day of the week by using TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Day') to extract the weekday name (like 'Monday', 'Tuesday', etc.) from the sale_date column. It then uses COUNT(product_id) to count how many laptops were sold on each of those days. Grouping by the formatted day allows you to analyze sales trends by weekday and identify which days tend to have higher or lower sales activity.

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(product_id) AS total_sold_units,
  TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Day') AS day_of_week
FROM laptop_sales
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Day');
```
#### Here is the Breakdown of laptop sales across different day of the week :

The data shows total laptop sales distributed across each day of the week. Sunday recorded the highest number of sales (12 units), followed by Thursday (10 units) and Tuesday (8 units), suggesting weekends and early weekdays are peak sales periods. Wednesday and Monday saw the lowest activity with just 3 and 4 units sold, respectively. This pattern can help businesses optimize marketing and stock planning for high-demand days.
